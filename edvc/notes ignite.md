# UNIT III: SOLUTION DESIGN, PROTOTYPING & OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT

## 3.1 CUSTOMER JOBS-TO-BE-DONE (JTBD)

### Definition
**Jobs-to-be-Done** is a framework that focuses on understanding the underlying process or "job" that customers are trying to accomplish, rather than focusing on the product itself. It answers the question: "What job is the customer hiring this product to do?"

### Core Concept
Customers don't buy products or services; they "hire" them to get a job done. Understanding the job helps create better solutions.

**Example:** People don't want a quarter-inch drill; they want a quarter-inch hole. Actually, they want to hang a picture. Really, they want to feel their house is decorated and welcoming.

### Types of Jobs

## 4.4 FINANCIAL PLANNING FOR STARTUPS

### Types of Costs

#### 1. **Fixed Costs**
**Definition:** Costs that don't change with sales volume

**Examples:**
- Rent/Lease
- Salaries (permanent staff)
- Insurance
- Software subscriptions
- Utilities (base amount)
- Depreciation

**Characteristics:**
- Predictable
- Must be paid regardless of revenue
- Easier to budget
- Higher risk in early stages

#### 2. **Variable Costs**
**Definition:** Costs that change proportionally with sales

**Examples:**
- Raw materials
- Production costs
- Shipping and delivery
- Transaction fees
- Sales commissions
- Packaging

**Characteristics:**
- Scale with revenue
- Lower risk
- Margin impact
- Controllable

#### 3. **Semi-Variable Costs**
**Definition:** Costs with both fixed and variable components

**Examples:**
- Utilities (base + usage)
- Sales team (salary + commission)
- Customer support (base team + contractors)

### Financial Planning Components

#### 1. **Sales Plan**

**Elements:**
- Target customer segments
- Pricing strategy
- Sales channels
- Volume projections
- Revenue timeline

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Revenue = (Number of Customers Ã— Average Sale Price)
Annual Revenue = Monthly Revenue Ã— 12
```

#### 2. **People Plan**

**Elements:**
- Team structure
- Hiring timeline
- Compensation
- Benefits
- Contractors vs. employees

**Calculation:**
```
Total People Cost = (Salaries + Benefits + Taxes + Recruitment)
```

#### 3. **Financial Plan**

**Core Financial Statements:**

##### Income Statement (P&L)
```
Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
= Operating Income (EBITDA)
- Taxes
= Net Income
```

##### Cash Flow Statement
```
Cash from Operations
+ Cash from Investing
+ Cash from Financing
= Net Cash Flow
```

##### Balance Sheet
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

### Unit Economics

#### Definition
**Unit economics** measures profitability on a per-unit basis (typically per customer)

#### Key Metrics

##### 1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
**Formula:**
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Costs / Number of New Customers
```

**Example:**
- Marketing spend: $10,000
- New customers: 100
- CAC = $10,000 / 100 = $100

##### 2. **Lifetime Value (LTV)**
**Formula:**
```
LTV = (Average Revenue per Customer Ã— Gross Margin %) Ã— Average Customer Lifespan
```

**Example:**
- Monthly revenue per customer: $50
- Gross margin: 70%
- Average lifespan: 24 months
- LTV = ($50 Ã— 0.70) Ã— 24 = $840

##### 3. **LTV:CAC Ratio**
**Formula:**
```
LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Less than 1:1 = Losing money on each customer
- 1:1 = Breaking even
- 3:1 = Good, sustainable
- Higher than 5:1 = Underinvesting in growth

**Example:**
- LTV: $840
- CAC: $100
- Ratio = 840 / 100 = 8.4:1 (Excellent)

##### 4. **CAC Payback Period**
**Formula:**
```
CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer Ã— Gross Margin %)
```

**Example:**
- CAC: $100
- Monthly revenue: $50
- Gross margin: 70%
- Payback = $100 / ($50 Ã— 0.70) = 2.86 months

**Benchmarks:**
- Less than 12 months = Good
- 12-18 months = Acceptable
- More than 18 months = Challenging

##### 5. **Contribution Margin**
**Formula:**
```
Contribution Margin = Revenue per Unit - Variable Costs per Unit
```

**Example:**
- Price: $100
- Variable costs: $40
- Contribution Margin = $100 - $40 = $60 (60%)

### Financial Projections

#### Time Horizons

| Period | Detail Level | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Monthly** | High detail | Operational planning |
| **Quarterly** | Medium detail | Tactical adjustments |
| **Annual** | Lower detail | Strategic planning |
| **3-5 Years** | Directional | Fundraising, vision |

#### Key Assumptions

Document all assumptions:
- Market size
- Market share
- Pricing
- Cost structure
- Growth rates
- Customer behavior
- Competition

### Break-Even Analysis

**Definition:** Point where total revenue equals total costs

**Formula:**
```
Break-Even Units = Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
```

**Example:**
- Fixed costs: $50,000/month
- Price per unit: $100
- Variable cost: $40
- Break-even = $50,000 / ($100 - $40) = 833 units

### Financial Metrics Dashboard

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Gross Margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | >70% for SaaS |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Income / Revenue | Positive by year 3 |
| **Cash Runway** | Cash Balance / Monthly Burn | >12 months |
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | Monthly Operating Expenses | Decreasing trend |
| **Revenue Growth** | (Current - Previous) / Previous | >20% MoM early |

### Advantages of Financial Planning
âœ“ Identifies resource needs
âœ“ Enables informed decisions
âœ“ Attracts investors
âœ“ Sets measurable goals
âœ“ Highlights risks
âœ“ Guides spending priorities
âœ“ Tracks progress

### Common Mistakes

**Approach:**
1. Lead with story (engage emotionally)
2. Support with data (build credibility)
3. Return to story (maintain connection)

**Example:**
*"Meet John [story], a truck driver losing sleep over logistics [emotion]. 68% of truckers face this [data]. Our AI solution gives John his sleep back [story + solution]. Drivers report 40% less stress [data]. 'I'm home for dinner now,' John says [story]."*

### Storytelling Principles

| Principle | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Authenticity** | Be genuine, not scripted | Share real experiences |
| **Simplicity** | Clear and concise | Avoid jargon |
| **Specificity** | Concrete details | Names, numbers, moments |
| **Emotion** | Connect feelingly | Share struggles, victories |
| **Relatability** | Universal themes | Common experiences |
| **Progression** | Clear arc | Beginning, middle, end |

### Tailoring Stories to Audience

**Tone:**
- Inspirational
- Relationship-oriented

### Storytelling Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Better Approach |

| **No emotion** | Doesn't resonate | Share authentic moments |
| **All data, no story** | Doesn't stick | Integrate narratives |
| **Unrealistic hero** | Not relatable | Flawed, real characters |
| **Unclear villain** | No tension | Define the problem clearly |
| **Weak resolution** | Unsatisfying | Clear, credible solution |

| **High Quality Images** | Professional, relevant | No stock photo clichÃ©s |
| **Consistent Design** | Same fonts, colors, style | Professional template |
| **Readable Fonts** | Minimum 24pt | Avoid fancy fonts |
| **White Space** | Don't overcrowd | Breathing room |

#### Content Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clarity over Cleverness** | Simple language beats jargon |
| **Show Don't Tell** | Visuals > text |
| **Data-Driven** | Numbers and proof |
| **Story Arc** | Logical flow |
| **Audience-Focused** | What they care about |

### Pitch Deck Mistakes

|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Too long** | Loses attention | 10-15 slides max |

| **Ignoring competition** | Not credible | Acknowledge honestly |
| **Unrealistic projections** | Lacks trust | Conservative but ambitious |
| **Poor design** | Looks amateur | Professional template |
| **No ask** | Unclear next steps | Specific request |
