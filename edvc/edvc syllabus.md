- Continuously needed but recoverable
- **Example**: â‚¹5 lakhs for monthly inventory

**B. Cost Breakdown**

**Fixed Assets**:

| Item | Estimation Method | Example Amount |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Land** | Market rate per sq ft Ã— area | â‚¹30 lakhs |
| **Building/Construction** | â‚¹1000-5000 per sq ft Ã— sq ft | â‚¹20 lakhs (2000 sq ft) |
| **Machinery** | Quotations from suppliers | â‚¹15 lakhs |
| **Equipment** | Market rates | â‚¹5 lakhs |
| **Furniture/Fixtures** | Furniture quotes | â‚¹2 lakhs |

| **Pre-Operating Expenses** | Registration, licenses, training | â‚¹2 lakhs |
| **Contingency** | 10% buffer | â‚¹8.4 lakhs |
| **Total** | | **â‚¹92.4 lakhs** |

**Working Capital Calculation**:

**Method 1: Percentage of Sales**
- Working capital = 10-15% of annual sales
- Example: If annual sales = â‚¹100 lakhs, WC = â‚¹10-15 lakhs

**Method 2: Operating Cycle Method**
- WC = (Average Inventory + Average Receivable) - Average Payable
- Example: (â‚¹5L + â‚¹3L) - â‚¹2L = â‚¹6 lakhs

**Method 3: Cash Conversion Cycle**
- Days needed to convert cash outflow back to inflow
- Example: 60 days Ã— daily operating cost (â‚¹2L/30 = â‚¹0.67L/day) = â‚¹40 lakhs

**C. Capital Budgeting Techniques**

**1. Payback Period**
- Time to recover initial investment
- **Formula**: Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow
- **Example**: â‚¹50 lakhs investment / â‚¹10 lakhs annual cash flow = 5 years
- **Decision**: If payback < acceptable period (typically 3-5 years), accept project

**2. Return on Investment (ROI)**
- **Formula**: ROI = (Net Profit / Initial Investment) Ã— 100
- **Example**: â‚¹10 lakhs annual profit / â‚¹50 lakhs investment = 20% ROI
- **Decision**: Higher ROI preferred (>15% for most businesses)

**3. Break-Even Analysis**
- **Formula**: Break-even = Fixed Cost / (Selling Price - Variable Cost per unit)
- **Example**: FC = â‚¹5L, SP = â‚¹500/unit, VC = â‚¹300/unit
- BE = â‚¹500,000 / (500-300) = 2,500 units
- **Meaning**: Must sell 2,500 units to cover all costs

### Practice Problems with Solutions

#### Problem 1: Capital Budgeting for Bakery
**Question**: Ramesh wants to start a bakery. Fixed assets cost â‚¹25 lakhs, and he projects monthly sales of â‚¹3 lakhs with variable costs of 40%. Fixed monthly costs are â‚¹50,000. Calculate: a) Break-even sales, b) Break-even units (assuming â‚¹500/unit), c) Payback period, d) ROI (annual).

**Solution**:

**Given Data:**
- Fixed Assets (Capital Investment) = â‚¹25 lakhs
- Monthly Sales Projected = â‚¹3 lakhs
- Variable Cost = 40% of sales
- Fixed Monthly Cost = â‚¹50,000
- Price per unit = â‚¹500

**a) Break-Even Sales (Monthly):**

Formula: BE Sales = Fixed Cost / (1 - Variable Cost Ratio)
- Contribution Ratio = 1 - 40% = 60%
- BE Sales = â‚¹50,000 / 0.60 = **â‚¹83,333**

**Verification**: 
- Sales â‚¹83,333 - Variable cost (40%) â‚¹33,333 = Contribution â‚¹50,000 = Fixed costs

**b) Break-Even Units:**

- BE Units = BE Sales / Price per unit
- BE Units = â‚¹83,333 / â‚¹500 = **167 units monthly**

**c) Payback Period:**

- Annual Cash Flow = (Sales - Variable costs - Fixed costs)
- Annual = (â‚¹36 lakhs - â‚¹14.4 lakhs - â‚¹6 lakhs) = **â‚¹15.6 lakhs**
- Payback = Capital Investment / Annual Cash Flow
- Payback = â‚¹25 lakhs / â‚¹15.6 lakhs = **1.6 years â‰ˆ 19 months**

**d) ROI (Annual):**

- Annual Profit = Cash Flow = â‚¹15.6 lakhs
- ROI = (Annual Profit / Capital Investment) Ã— 100
- ROI = (â‚¹15.6 L / â‚¹25 L) Ã— 100 = **62.4%**

**Analysis**:
- Break-even is â‚¹83,333/month, current sales â‚¹3 lakhsâ€”Safe margin
- Payback in 19 months is excellent
- 62% ROI is strong for bakery business
- **Recommendation**: Project is financially viable

**Solution**:

**Capital Requirement Breakdown:**
- Fixed Assets (Website, inventory): â‚¹45 lakhs
- Working Capital: â‚¹20 lakhs
- Contingency and Miscellaneous: â‚¹10 lakhs
- **Total: â‚¹75 lakhs**

**Capital Shortfall: â‚¹63 lakhs**

**Finance Mobilization Strategy:**

| Source | Amount | % | Approach | Timeline |
|--------|--------|---|----------|----------|
| **Personal Savings** | â‚¹12L | 16% | Already available | Immediate |

| **Vendor Credit** | â‚¹8L | 11% | 90-day payment terms from suppliers | Ongoing |
| **Total** | **â‚¹75L** | **100%** | | |

**Detailed Plan:**

**Month 1:**
1. **Formalize Family Investment**
   - â‚¹15 lakhs from family (â‚¹10L from parents as equity; â‚¹5L as loan)
   - Prepare formal loan agreement for â‚¹5L portion
   - Lower interest rate (5-7%) vs. market

2. **Apply for Government Scheme**

#### Problem 2: Growth Strategy Selection
**Question**: Akhil runs a successful coffee shop earning â‚¹2 crore annual profit with 5 outlets in Mumbai. He's considering: 1) Adding 10 more outlets in Mumbai, 2) Expanding to Bangalore/Delhi/Pune, 3) Franchising model. Evaluate using growth strategy framework.

**Solution**:

**Current Situation Analysis:**
- Successful brand in Mumbai (market penetration complete)
- Proven model with 5 outlets
- Cash available for expansion (â‚¹1-2 crore profit)
- Market opportunity for more expansion

**Growth Strategy Options:**

**Option 1: Market Penetration (10 more outlets in Mumbai)**

**Strategy**: Increase market share in existing market

**Advantages:**
- Minimal product development cost
- Use proven operational systems
- Familiar market and customer base
- Lower risk
- Quick breakeven (10-12 months)
- Existing supply chain efficient

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited growth potential (saturating Mumbai market)
- Higher competition from existing outlets
- Cannibalization risk (new outlet takes customers from old)
- Real estate costs rising in Mumbai
- Limited long-term growth

**Financial Model:**
- Per outlet investment: â‚¹40 lakhs
- Total investment: 10 Ã— â‚¹40L = â‚¹4 crore
- Existing profit: â‚¹2 crore/year (insufficient)
- Need external financing: â‚¹2 crore
- Expected payback: 18-20 months

**Score: 6/10** (Safe but limited potential)

---

**Option 2: Geographic Expansion (New Cities)**

**Strategy**: Market expansion with existing product

**Advantages:**
- Larger market opportunity (3 new metros)
- Proven business model
- No product development needed
- Accessible to investors (scalability story)
- Higher long-term growth
- Diversified geographic risk

**Disadvantages:**
- New market dynamics (customer preferences, competition)
- Operational complexity managing multiple cities
- Supply chain setup in new cities
- Brand establishment needed
- Higher risk than penetration
- Team expansion and training needed
- Longer payback (18-24 months per outlet)

**Financial Model:**
- Per outlet: â‚¹45 lakhs (higher setup in new metros)
- Expansion: 3 cities Ã— 3-4 outlets = 10-12 outlets
- Total investment: â‚¹45L Ã— 11 = â‚¹5 crore
- Phased approach: Year 1 = 4 outlets (â‚¹1.8 crore); Year 2 = 7 outlets (â‚¹3.2 crore)
- Expected combined profit in 3 years: â‚¹8-10 crores
- Payback: 2-3 years overall

**Score: 8/10** (Higher growth, manageable risk)

---

**Option 3: Franchising Model**

**Strategy**: Rapid expansion through partner capital

**Advantages:**
- Minimal capital requirement from Akhil (mostly franchisee capital)
- Rapid expansion (20-30 outlets in 2 years)
- Lower operational burden
- Royalty income (recurring revenue stream)
- Scalable without proportional investment
- Brand extension quickly
- Attractive to investors/VCs

**Disadvantages:**
- Quality control challenges
- Brand reputation risk if franchisees underperform
- Franchisee relationship management
- Legal and regulatory complexity
- Revenue per outlet lower (40-50% of company-operated)
- Takes 6-12 months to structure franchise model
- Franchisees cannibalize company-operated outlets
- Initial investment to create franchise model: â‚¹30-50 lakhs

**Financial Model:**
- Company-operated outlets (5 existing, add 5 new): 10 Ã— â‚¹2.5 lakh/year profit = â‚¹2.5 crore
- Franchise revenue (20 outlets Ã— â‚¹15 lakhs royalty average): â‚¹3 crore
- Total Year 1 revenue: â‚¹5.5 crores (vs. â‚¹2 crore now)
- Expansion investment needed: â‚¹50 lakhs (franchise setup)
- Payback on franchise setup: 1 year

**Score: 9/10** (Highest growth, capital-light)

---

**Comparative Matrix:**

| Factor | Weight | Penetration | Geographic | Franchise |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Growth Potential** | 25% | 4/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 |
| **Required Investment** | 20% | 3/10 | 5/10 | 9/10 |
| **Risk Level** | 20% | 8/10 | 6/10 | 4/10 |
| **Operational Complexity** | 15% | 8/10 | 5/10 | 4/10 |
| **Timeline to Scale** | 10% | 7/10 | 5/10 | 9/10 |
| **Controllability** | 10% | 10/10 | 8/10 | 5/10 |
| **Total Score** | 100% | **6.4** | **6.9** | **7.5** |

#### Problem 3: Business Performance Monitoring
**Question**: Asha runs a boutique garment business. Last month: Sales â‚¹25 lakhs (target â‚¹30L), Profit â‚¹2.5 lakhs (target â‚¹4L), Customer complaints rose 15%, Production defects 2.5% (target 1.5%), New customers: 20 (target 50). Analyze performance and recommend actions.

**Solution**:

|-----|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Sales** | â‚¹30L | â‚¹25L | 83% | âš ï¸ Below |
| **Profit** | â‚¹4L | â‚¹2.5L | 63% | âš ï¸ Significantly Below |

| **Product Quality** | 1.5% defect | 2.5% defect | Poor | âš ï¸ Deteriorated |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | Stable | +15% complaints | Worse | ðŸ”´ Deteriorated |

---

**Issue Analysis:**

**Issue 1: Revenue Shortfall (17% below target)**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Possible causes: Market demand down? Marketing ineffective? Pricing too high? Competition increased?
- Lower new customer acquisition (40% of target) is key indicator

**Data Indicates**: Customer acquisition problem, not demand issue

**Actions:**
1. Analyze which channels brought only 20 vs. expected 50 customers
2. Review marketing spend effectiveness
3. Check if referral/repeat customer rate is good (if yes, issue is new customer acquisition)
4. Evaluate pricing vs. competition
5. Assess product quality perception (tie to complaints)

---

**Issue 2: Profit Margin Compression (10% vs. 13% target)**

**Calculation:**
- Sales down 17% but profit down 37.5%
- Indicates cost control problem

**Cost Analysis:**
- Fixed costs likely same (rent, salaries)
- Variable costs probably increased (raw material, labor efficiency)
- Lower volume spread fixed costs over fewer sales

**Actions:**
1. Conduct detailed cost breakdown: Materialsv.s. Labor vs. Overhead
2. Identify where costs increased
3. Negotiate supplier discounts for bulk commitment
4. Improve production efficiency
5. Reduce labor overtime
6. Consider price increase if market allows (competitive check)

---

**Issue 3: Quality Deterioration (2.5% vs. 1.5% target)**

**This is Concerning Because:**
- Quality issues directly linked to customer complaints (+15%)
- Higher defects increase returns and rework
- Damages brand reputation

**Root Causes to Investigate:**
- Rushed production (trying to hit lower sales target through volume)?
- New/untrained staff?
- Machine maintenance issues?
- Supplier material quality issue?
- Inspection process weakened?

**Actions:**
1. Immediate quality audit
2. Identify defect types and causes
3. Retrain production team if needed
4. Increase inspection checkpoints
5. Communicate with customers about quality improvement
6. Offer discounts/replacement for defective units

---

**Issue 4: Customer Acquisition Crisis (40% of target)**

**This is Critical Because:**
- New customers fuel business growth
- Indicates marketing/sales problem
- Future growth at risk

**Possible Causes:**
- Reduced marketing spend?
- Changed marketing channels (less effective)?
- Word-of-mouth declined due to quality issues?
- Competition stealing customers?
- Pricing too high?

**Actions:**
1. Review marketing activities vs. last month (budget, channels, reach)
2. Analyze where customers are coming from (digital, referral, retail, etc.)
3. Identify if repeat customer rate is good (means product OK but new customer problem)
4. Increase marketing intensity temporarily
5. Launch referral program (incentivize existing customers)
6. Run social media campaign
7. Partner with influencers
8. Special promotions for new customers
