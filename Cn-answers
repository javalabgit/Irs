## Q1: Distance-Vector vs Link-State Routing

**Distance-vector** routers use neighbor info and exchange vectors periodically. **Link-state** routers build a complete map of the network with link info, running algorithms like Dijkstra’s for best paths.

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature                | Distance-Vector            | Link-State                |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Info Shared            | Vectors w/ neighbors      | Complete link-state map   |
| Network View           | Local                     | Global                    |
| Algorithm              | Bellman-Ford              | Dijkstra’s                |
| Convergence Speed      | Slow                      | Fast                      |
| Resource Usage         | Low                       | High                      |
| Loops                  | Persistent possible       | Mainly transient          |

## Q2: TCP Congestion Control Operation

TCP employs **Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, and Congestion Detection** (additive increase/multiplicative decrease) to dynamically adjust traffic rate.

**Phases Table:**

| Slow Start           | Rapid exponential growth of cwnd             |
| Avoidance            | Linear increase after threshold              |
| Detection            | Drops on loss, resets cwnd or reduces window |

| B     | 10           | 16       | 16        | 172.16.x.x      | ~65,000           |
| C     | 110          | 24       | 8         | 192.168.1.x     | 256               |
| D     | 1110         | -        | -         | multicast       | -                 |

## Q10: HTTP Communication Model

HTTP uses a simple request-response over TCP where client sends a method+URL, receives a status+body, and session is stateless.

|--------------|----------------------------|
| Request      | GET /index.html HTTP/1.1   |
| Response     | HTTP/1.1 200 OK            |
